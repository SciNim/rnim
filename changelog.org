* v0.1.4
- add ={.exportR.}= pragma, which takes care of attaching the correct
  pragmas to export to a shared library usable in R
* v0.1.3
- fix accessing integer arrays from Nim, which makes interfacing of
  Nim from R finally workable for simple types.
* v0.1.2
- =callEval= now works correctly with strings as function names,
  e.g. to allow R functions with dots, =data.frame=
- add a =Rctx= macro, which can be used for more convenient R calls
  (see README)
* v0.1.1
- fix project structure to be nimble installable
- add changelog
- replace impl of =source=
* v0.1.0
- first basic prototype supporting
  - call R functions from Nim
  - auto convert basic Nim types to R =SEXP=
  - allow conversion of =SEXP= back to Nim types using =to=
- calling Nim from R is still broken (segfaults)
